**This is Alba's blog website. Thank you for visiting! In my blog I will document and write about many different things. I sometimes enjoys writing, and also enjoy web developing. I am currently a student at Raritan Valley Community College, and my major is interface design and web development, of course. I hope to graduate Spring of 2023.**
